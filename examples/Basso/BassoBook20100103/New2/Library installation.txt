Library installation

You should install these libraries in TINA in order to make your own circuits with the models in this book.
Note that you need a higher version than the demo to build and run your own circuits.

To install the libraries do the following:

  1.Copy Basso.ddb into TINA's root folder.

  2.Copy all *.lib, *.tld files into  TINA's Spicelib folder.

  3.Start TINA, in  most cases TINA will rebuild the libraries. You will a message.
    If no message is displayed you should rebuild the libraries using the Tools/Re-build Library command.

  4.Now you can select the new models as TINA components by clicking on the 
    Spice macros/SMPS and Other Components icons.
