TEXT -568 -448 Left 0 ;This file demonstrates the use of the SAVEBIAS command to record node \nvoltages & currents for use as '.IC' values for the following simulation.\n \n1) Run the simulation, and halt it after approximately 30ms.\n \n2) The simulation will generate a file named 'initial_condition.bp'.  Rename \nthat file 'initial_condition.ic'.\n \n3) Open the file 'initial_condition.ic', and change the LTspice keyword from\nNODESET to IC.  Save the file.\n \n4) On the LTspice schematic, uncomment the 'INCLUDE' line.\n \n5) Run the simulation.  Note that the capacitor voltage starts charging at the\n10ms interval just before you stopped it.\n \nNotes:\n- If you have subcircuits that also need initial conditions set, make sure \nthose signals are recorded via the Control Panel-Save Defaults'.\n- 'IC' commands manually added to the schematic seem to override the \nexternal IC commands.
