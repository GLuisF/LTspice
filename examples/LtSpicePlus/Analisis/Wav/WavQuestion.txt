Hello,

trying to export wave Data from the example
Relaxation oscillator from this group, I wonder
not to see any signal in V(N001) beside the
initial ramp. It looks like saturation, although
ringing is ok. What did I do wrong?

thanks to all, Arnold

Hello Arnold,
your oscillator has a triangle waveform at around +2V at V(N001).
This is always above +1V and so all stored values are 1(V).
You need an attenuator (e.g. E-source with gain=0.2) to bring that
voltage level down to within +/-1V.
Those limits are described in the LTSPICE help pages.
