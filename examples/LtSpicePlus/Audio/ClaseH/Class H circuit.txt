Class H sub amplifier using two UnivSMPS circuits.

The circuit does not simulate perfectly but does the most 
possible without getting too complex.  My goal was a sub
woofer amplifier which performs at least as well as a good
class D amp, but with more simplicity.  Class D is good,
but I have not reached a circuit configuration that I am 
pleased with.  This class H circuit has fewer parts than
all the class D circuits which I have played around with
so far.  Yet, even the more complicated ones still did not
seem quite what I wanted.

The circuit, like all my other simulated circuits will not
perform identically to the simulation.  Some components
may need to be added, altered in value, or may be
omittable.

I have uploaded the circuit in 16 color bitmap form so that
it can be viewed in high resolution to make its large size,
page-wise, easier to follow.  You can zoom in as large as
needed within limits.

Like all my circuits, I occasionally return to update and
edit as I feel is helpful and as my time permits. It may 
help to check over the files occasionally for modifications.

I have long held the view that high power is only needed 
for bass audio spectrum amplifiers, especially since I find
that the highest fidelity subwoofer systems use sealed
enclosures with just enough volume so that the peak in
response in the upper sub bass region can be attenuated
by active equalization.  No other simple sub woofer type
can be made to give smooth, response as easily.  I also
recommend using plenty of polyester stuffing to further
smooth the response.
