Here are two SPDT switch models and symbols based on a CD4007 application
called "transfer switch" from the Intersil CD4007 datasheet. Although I tried to be 
careful mapping the netlists to device pin connections, beware - the author is human. 
These switch models have NOT been tested under real world conditions, please use with care. 

These models are only simplified approximations, at best. Equivalent CD4007 pin 
connections to implement these switches are listed in the file 4007spdt.sub.

Use as two into one, or one-of-two data multiplexers for analog or CMOS logic level applications. The IOs are bilateral. Device package capacitance and other parasitic effects have not been modeled here - these models' performances should not be expected to mimic real world. (Notice the lack of switching transients and other real-world buggerances as seen when running other CMOS switch models.) I think these should be perhaps be considered as behavioral models.

Place all files in the same folder and CMOS_SPDT.asc should run without a hitch.
