A Collection Of Tapped Potentiometers              Helmut Sennewald,  V1.1
 
A new symbol "potentiometer_tapped.asy" has been generated for all the new potentiometers.
Put this file into the LTSPICE installation path lib\sym \... or into your working directory.
The file "potentiometer_tapped.lib" contains the X-subcircuits of all these potentiometers.
There is a linear, log. and an arbitrary model with a fixed tap.
Put the file "potentiometer_tapped.lib" into the folder 
...\Progams\Ltc\SwCADIII\lib\sub
or into the directory where your schematic "potentiometer_tapped.asc" is.
 
pot_tap_lin : ideal linear resistance dependency
pot_tap_pow : ideal power function resistance dependency
pot_tap_plog : ideal logarithm function resistance dependency
pot_tap_nlog : ideal logarithm function resistance dependency
pot_tap_tab: arbitrary(table) based resistance dependency

LTSPICE have to be restarted before the new symbol can be used.

How to select the model?
Move the cursor over the potentiometer then click the right mouse button. 
Then the the model name and the parameters can be changed. 
The model file has to be loaded with a  .include potentiometer_tapped.lib 
statement to the schematic.

*     RTOT = total resistance
*     WIPER = ratio of travel of the wiper
*     RTAP = resistance between "4" and "2" at position TAP.
*     TAP = ratio of travel when the wiper reaches the tap, e.g. 0.5
