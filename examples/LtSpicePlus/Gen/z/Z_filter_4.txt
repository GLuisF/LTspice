Simulation Of Sampled Systems
-----------------------------
Please copy all files into one working diectory.
The .TRAN simulation gives an oversampled output. This is no problem
as long as you only plot the data.
If you need one value per system time step (e.g. 100us), then you
need some pot processing.

You could export the data with LTSPICE and undersample with your own
program or you use the "ltsputil.exe" tool. This program can undersample 
the LTSPICE output file in steps of 100us and export this data to a text file.

Instructions for sampling a .raw file
-------------------------------------
Goal: Undersample the rawfile at the midpoint of each system step.
This requires two runs of ltsputil.exe, equalize(subsample) and export.

Step-1: Undersample with the equalize-function.

You can still look to this "x.raw" file with LTSPICE.
If you enable "mark data points", you will see it exactly at every 0.1ms.

The start time should be set to half(here 0.05e-3) the system time step.
tstop = tstart + (n-1)*tsystem            tsystem=0.1e-3
n = 150 = (tstop-tstart)/tsystem + 1

Each variable name in the new rawfile will be extended by "_e".

  ltsputil.exe -eo z_filter_4_time_sh.raw x.raw 150 "_e" 0.05e-3 14.95e-3



Step-2: Export selected data to a text file
Export the time and V(out_e). Variable 0 stands for time.

  ltsputil.exe -xo0 x.raw x.txt "%14.6e" "," "" 0 V(out_e)



Another example:
Export index, time, and V(out_e). 
An additional running index from 0 to n is placed in the first column.

  ltsputil.exe -xoi0 x.raw x.txt "%14.6e" "," "" 0 V(out_e)
