Notes for: coherent-rx-e.zip

Two simulations for the IF path of a I-Q-receiver.
The design connects to the outputs of the RF-mixers which combine
the sin- and cos-carriers from the LO with the input signal.

coherent-rx-1e:
  Receiver block diagram, input is a simple continuous wave (CW) signal.
  You may play with the frequency parameters fs, ft, fm and fg, to test
  different setups.
  Two default settings for a CW and a SSB receiver are included.
  (See middle of the sheet and the two sources on the left side)

coherent-rx-3e:
  The same circuitry, but the input is taken from the file "iqdemod.wav"
  (Stereo, preferrable 16 bits and 22050 Hz or 44100 Hz sample rate).
  The signal is demodulated and the resulting audio is written to the
  file "nfsignal.wav".

The zip-file also contains some simple re-usable blocks for adition,
subtraction, multiplication and an adjustable 7th-order Butterworth
low-pass filter (use parameter fg to set the 3dB corner frequency).

Have fun,
Andreas (DL4SDC).
