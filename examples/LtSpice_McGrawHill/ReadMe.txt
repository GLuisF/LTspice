Dear Student, Instructor, or interested party:

Now that you have unzipped the download, you have a PowerPoint Presentation and approximately 50 circuit files.  Get started by viewing the PP presentation.  This will help you decide to download the free simulator from Linear Technology:

We at McGraw-Hill hope that you will find the PowerPoint presentation and the sample circuits useful.
