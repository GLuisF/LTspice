Version 1.01
Please read the help file in the folder   "Digital 74HCxxx".
The example circuit uses a device "dview5" which needs the symbol dview5.asy 
and  the library file dview.lib. Both files are in the folder  "Digital 
74HCxxx". The CD4000 devices use VDD instead of VCC for the supply voltage
node and the supply voltage value.
This is the only difference to the 74HC and 74HCT devices.

I will upload a HEF4000 library later. This HEF4000 series from Philips is faster.  Therefore you have to set the paramter SPEED=1 to SPEED=0.6 when
you use the HEF4000 devices with the CD4000 library. 




One user reported a convergence problem with a CD4049 oscillator circuit.
This problem could be solved in different ways. 

Chance 1:
Use the alternate solver:
Control Panel->SPICE Solver-Alternate

Chance 2:
Reduce the value Gmin in the SPICE control panel:
Control Panel->SPICE Gmin 1e-11

Chance 3:
Use the .TRAN ..... startup command instead of .TRAN ... .
It hasn't helped in this case, but in some other cases.


Version V1.02
Symbol of CD4027B corrected. It had one pin too much.
