Some Information about the NiMH SPICE model.  

The basic idea for the discharge model is from an EDN article,
February 2 1995. The author was Steven C Hageman.

Here is the article published in EDN magazine eight years ago.

I did firstly some changes on the original discharge model "NIMH". 
The result was the model(subcircuit) "NIMH1".
Then I added a charging model and finished with the model "RECBAT". 
I recommend to use the newest model "RECBAT" only.
That's the reason why I put all my older data into the folder "old".

The files are in the directory of
Files->Tut->NiMH battery
There is a nice symbol also there.

Put the symbol file "battery_NiMH.asy" into the
LTSPICE "...\Lib\sym\misc" directory before you start LTSPICE.
Then start LTSPICE and load "NiMH_Test.asc". The model
file "NiMH.sub" should be copied to the same directory as the
schematic file "NiMH_Test.asc" or put it into the folder 
of your LTSPICE installation ...LTC\SWCADIII\LIB\SUB .

The schematic used for model development is in the file NiMH_develop.asc.
The subcircuit NIMH_AA is equivalent to the netlist of this circuit.

Have fun with it.

Helmut

PS: I haven't understood what the original SOC output shows. So I
routed another internal node to this pin. I believe this third pin
now shows the actual charge of the battery.
