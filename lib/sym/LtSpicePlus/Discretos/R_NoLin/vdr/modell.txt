VARISTOR MODEL
==============   

The varistor model basically consists of 4 elements:

	   O                    
	   |            The resistance R_SERIES is required for
           |            mathematical reasons and has the
           |            constant value of R_SERIES = 100 nOHM.

	 |   |
R_SERIES |   |          In accordance with the equivalent circuit the 
         |   |          elements L_SERIES and C_PAR represent
         |   |          the lead inductance L and the parallel capacitance C.
         +-+-+          The values of L and C differ from type to type and
           |            are defined as parameters in file SIOV.LIB.

	 |XXX|          characteristic of the varistor and takes into 
L_SERIES |XXX|          account the elements R_V, R_Z and R_B of the
	 |XXX|          equivalent circuit. The voltage-current dependence
