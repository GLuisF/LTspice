This set is adapted from the Spice model for the THS4271
from the Texas Instruments web site, file sloj151.zip.  The
key change is that the pin assignments have been made to
correspond to the pins on an 8-pin package for this part.
This enables more graceful use of an exported netlist in the
FreePCB PC layout program.
