How to use the subcircuit X-models.
-----------------------------------

1.
Put the x-symbol file(s) (xnmos.asy, xpmos.asy,...) to the 
..SwCADIII\lib\sym directory.
In this case you can pick it from the symbols main menu.


2.
Put the subcircuit library file into your working directory or into the
SwitcherCADIII folder ..\SwCADIII\lib\sub .
This is your library file containing the subcircuit model(s) from the vendor.

3.  Add the command line    .include libname     to your schematic.
E.g.  .include mot_mos.lib  .


4.
Add the part like any normal transistor, e.g. "xnmos" to your schematic.

5.
Rename the attribute, e.g. X-NMOS to the name of your subcircuit model
in the mentioned library file.

6.
You can rename the symbol reference value, e.g. U1 to Q1 for example.


Hint:
You have to check with every new library that the pin order of the 
subcircuit is in the same order like pins of the symbol. If the pin order
is different then you have to change it either in the symbol or the library file.
I recommend to make a new variant of the symbol.
