A high level abstract behavioral PSPICE model has been developed to simulate 
the electrical performance of IR2104 driver. The model can be used in Pspice
version 8 or later (MicroSim Pspice). The IR2104 package includes three 
files:
   1. Pspice subcircuit model file (IR2104.sub)
   2. Symbol file (IR2104.slb)
   3. Instruction file (IR2104.txt)

The subcircuit model can be called directly in a plain Pspice netlist or
more user friendly pspice schematics. 

To use the subcircuit model within a netlist,simply copy and paste the sub-
circuit text in the netlist using a text editor. The subcircuit model can be
instantiated by an X (subcircuit installation) device. For example:
   Xdriver HIN LIN 0 LO VS HO VB VCC IR2104

To use the subcircuit model in a Pspice schematics editor, follow the steps 
below:
   1. Symbol libray Configuration. From a schematics editor, select “Editor 
      Configuration” from the “Options” menu to display “Editor Configura-
      tion” dialog box. Then select “Library Settings” to display “Library
      Settings” dialog box. Type the library name along with its path in the
      “Library Name” text box. Select the “Symbol” check box only. Click 
      “Add” or “Add Local” to set up a local or global library respectively.
   2. Model library file. In a schematics editor, from “Analysis” menu,select
      “Library and Include Files” to display its dialog box. Type in the sub-
      circuit model file name in the upper “File Name” text box. Then click 
      “Add Library*” (global use) or “Add Library” (local use).

Should convergence problems occur, in the .OPTION command, increase the 
ABSTOL = 1pA to 10pA or larger or increase RELTOL = 0.001 to 0.01 or larger.
In addition, adjusting step ceiling, total transient analysis time, or 
iteration number may help.
